# Social Media Back End

This application contains the necessary to create the back end of a basic social media application using Mongoose as a framework.

## Requirements
Be sure to run **npm install** and have **MongooseDB** installed prior to executing this application. 

Since we dont have a front end yet, you will also need to have **Insomina** to visualize the data.

Finally,Be sure to run the command **npm start** on the root directory to get the server started!

## Features:
We make use of Mongoose Models and schemas in order to setup our NoSQL database without needing to create the seeds for the database. Its ease to use make is much smoother to write and to read as well.

Our file structure uses Controllers to specify the actual handling of the routes for our application. Specific routes however are defined in the #Routes folder.
